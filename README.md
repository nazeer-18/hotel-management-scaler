# Hotel Room Management SPA

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed for the administration of hotel room bookings. It was developed as a part of the assignment for the Scaler internship program. The application facilitates the management of rooms, including booking, viewing, editing, and deleting bookings with comprehensive criteria such as room type, pricing, and user details.

## Features

- **Multiple Room Types with Pricing**: Supports various room types, each with its distinct pricing.
- **Booking Management**: Enables the admin to book rooms based on availability, preventing overlaps in bookings.
- **Dynamic Pricing Update**: Automatically updates the booking price upon changes in room type, start time, or end time.
- **Edit Bookings**: Allows for the modification of existing bookings with an updated price confirmation.
- **Cancellation Policy**: Implements a cancellation policy with varying refund rates depending on the cancellation timeframe.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts the layout for different screen sizes for accessibility on any device.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends booking confirmation emails to users (planned feature).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface, with Context API for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend** (Mock): For demonstration purposes, the backend operations are simulated within the React application.
- **Deployment**: The application is intended to be deployed on platforms such as Netlify or Vercel.
