# Hotel Room Management SPA

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed for the administration of hotel room bookings. It was developed as a part of the assignment for the Scaler internship program. The application facilitates the management of rooms, including booking, viewing, editing, and deleting bookings with comprehensive criteria such as room type, pricing, and user details.

## Features

- **Multiple Room Types with Pricing**: Supports various room types, each with its distinct pricing.
- **Booking Management**: Enables the admin to book rooms based on availability, preventing overlaps in bookings.
- **Dynamic Pricing Update**: Automatically updates the booking price upon changes in room type, start time, or end time.
- **Edit Bookings**: Allows for the modification of existing bookings with an updated price confirmation.
- **Cancellation Policy**: Implements a cancellation policy with varying refund rates depending on the cancellation timeframe.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts the layout for different screen sizes for accessibility on any device.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends booking confirmation emails to users (planned feature).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface, with Context API for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend** (Mock): For demonstration purposes, the backend operations are simulated within the React application.
- **Deployment**: The application is intended to be deployed on platforms such as Netlify or Vercel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hotel-room-management-spa.git
```

2. Install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

The application's interface is designed to be intuitive, specifically catering to the needs of hotel administration tasks. Here are the primary functions you can expect:

- **Home Page**: Displays a welcoming message and provides navigation to other functionalities within the application.
- **Book a Room**: Admins can book rooms by entering the userâ€™s email, selecting a room number, and specifying the booking start and end times.
- **View Bookings**: Offers a comprehensive list of all bookings, both upcoming and past, with options to filter by room number, room type, and booking dates.
- **Edit Booking**: Allows admins to modify the details of existing bookings, including user email, room number, start time, and end time, with an updated price confirmation.
- **Delete Booking**: Admins can cancel bookings, with the application displaying the refund amount according to the cancellation policy.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
